# 30 MFF WEBSITE
Communications Lab, Spring 2023

my website: https://sartbayeva.github.io/CommunicationsLab/Assignment1/index.html

# Project Description
This is a website centered around a film that was created and edited in 30 minutes. The film is about the coffee shop called "Blacksmith", which is located next to New York University Abu Dhabi. It has four pages: Home, About, 30 MFF, Menu and Contact.

# Inspiration
    Why did our production team choose this theme?
    
Blacksmith Coffee Shop is a popular spot for many students at NYUAD. Located in the heart of the university's campus, Blacksmith is a cozy, welcoming space that offers a range of coffee, tea, and snacks.

One of the main reasons why we love going to Blacksmith is the quality of the coffee. The coffee beans are sourced from high-quality growers, and the baristas are skilled at crafting a variety of drinks, from traditional espresso to more elaborate latte art creations. 

As it is our common place to study, socialize, or just grab a great cup of coffee, we decided to dedicate our film to this coffee shop!

# Implentation process of my website

As it was my first time creating a website, I followed many tutorials on YouTube along with learning from websites like stackoverflow and w3schools.

Let me talk about the overall process step by step:
1. I planned my website look by creating a wireframe on Adobe XD. 
2. I set up my development environment by installing Sublime Text editor.
3. I started creating the basic structure of my website using HTML tags. I made a header section with navigation links, a main home section with information about the coffee shop and its offerings (menu), and a footer section with contact information.
4. Then I styled my website with CSS. It included adding a color scheme, selecting fonts, and creating a layout with columns and rows.
5. As I wanted to add interactive features to my coffee shop website, I used JavaScript. I created a form for customers to submit their orders.
6. Finally, I tested and published it on the github.

# Challenges

When creating a navigation menu, it was difficult for me to make sure that the links are all working properly and that they are correctly formatted. Also, it was annoying how the sizes of images kept changing incorrectly. It took me a lot of trial and error to achieve the responsivness. As I wanted my website to look great on a variety of devices, including laptops, tablets, and mobile phones, I had to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions, which was not easy at all. 

# Reflection/Evaluation

I can say that my final website is quite close to my expectations. I am proud of myself. Even though it was challenging, and I had been procratinating because of that, it was a great learning experience. 

In terms of the design of my website, I guess I was able to create an aesthetically pleasing layout that is both functional and visually appealing. The use of color, typography, and images were well balanced and complemented each other. I specifically chose warm colors like sand brown to create a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. The website's layout turned out to be simple and easy to navigate, with clear sections. Also, I am glad that I added "menu" section, where I added some interactivity when a user hovers over the images. In terms of JavaScript, I was able to add some basic interactivity such as a form that allows users to order coffee online, and contact details.

While there were some challenges that I faced along the way, such as troubleshooting CSS layout issues and debugging, I was able to overcome them with my persistence.

Overall, the project was super enjoyable and I learned a lot from it!
